# Analysis and Challenges

The analysis was performed using images and charts. I did not encounter any challenge. However, I would recommend paying enough attention to the formulas and the data components chosen for the analysis.


# Results

	The Theater Outcomes by Launch Date analysis shows that most of the  shows with theater as a category had positive outcomes, especially those performed between the months of May and July.


	The Outcomes based on Goals analysis demonstrates that the shows with a goal less than $5000 have a higher percentager of success.


	The other possible tables and/or graphs that could be created for this analysis are Outcomes by launch date chart lines for all the categories as well as a chart line for an analysis on the outcome based on Pledged.
